**Hello! Welcome to Connor's math notes page.**

This is Connor Ding. You can learn more about me [here](https://www.czsding.com/). The purpose of this site is for me to organize math and coding notes related to different science and engeering topics. <br>

At the minimum, this site will be used for my own reference, but I hope that other people can find this site helpful. Gradually, I will be compiling notes from my engineering courses at Stanford as well as my mathematics courses at UC Santa Barbara. In addition, I will link some cool resources.
