[Graph Theory:](https://czsding40925.github.io/Graph-Basics) Based on Math 137A at UCSB. Currently contains basic definitions related to graphs. Visual included. Very incomplete (trees, matching, coloring, not included). <br>
[Linear Regression:](https://czsding40925.github.io/Linear-Regression) Based on Chapter 11 of Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer. It includes two comprehensive examples (one simple and one multiple linear regression). <br>
[ANOVA:](https://czsding40925.github.io/ANOVA) Based on Chapter 13 of Mathematical Statistics with Applications by Wackerly, Mendenhall, and Scheaffer. It includes one simple comprehensive example. A more generalized example will be included soon. <br>
[Differential Geometry:](https://czsding40925.github.io/Differential-Geometry) Based on Math 147A at UCSB. Currently contains basic definitions of parametrized curves and tangent vectors. Visual included. Very incomplete (curve theory, surface and surface theory not included). <br>
